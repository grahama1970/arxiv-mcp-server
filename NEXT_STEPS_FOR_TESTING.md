# Next Steps for CLAUDE.md Compliant Testing

## Current Status
- ❌ ALL mock-based tests have been DELETED
- ✅ conftest.py has been FIXED (no more MagicMock)
- ✅ Example compliant tests have been created
- ✅ Test reporter for real results is ready

## What Needs to Be Done

### 1. Create Real Integration Tests

Each test must:
- Use REAL ArXiv paper IDs
- Make REAL network calls
- Download REAL PDFs
- Extract REAL citations
- NO MOCKING ALLOWED

### 2. Example Test Structure

```python
# ✅ CORRECT - Real API call
async def test_search_quantum_papers():
    """Search for real quantum computing papers."""
    results = await search_arxiv("quantum computing", max_results=5)
    
    # Validate real results
    assert len(results) > 0, "Should find quantum papers"
    assert any("quantum" in r.title.lower() for r in results)
    
# ❌ WRONG - Any mocking
@patch('arxiv.Client')  # FORBIDDEN!
def test_search_mocked(mock_client):
    pass  # This violates CLAUDE.md
```

### 3. Test Data Strategy

Use these known stable papers:
- `1706.03762` - Attention Is All You Need (Transformers)
- `1810.04805` - BERT paper
- `1406.2661` - Generative Adversarial Networks
- `1412.6980` - Adam optimizer
- `1207.0580` - Dropout paper

### 4. Test Categories Needed

1. **Search Tests**
   - Search by query
   - Search by author
   - Search by category
   - Search by date range

2. **Download Tests**
   - Download single paper
   - Batch download
   - Check existing downloads
   - Handle download errors

3. **Processing Tests**
   - Extract citations from downloaded papers
   - Convert PDFs to markdown
   - Extract sections
   - Compare papers

4. **Storage Tests**
   - List papers
   - Get paper info
   - Manage annotations
   - System statistics

### 5. Running Tests

```bash
# With real ArXiv API calls
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/test_real_functionality.py -v

# Generate test report
python validate_real_functionality.py
```

### 6. Important Reminders

From CLAUDE.md:
- Line 101: "NEVER mock core functionality"
- Line 102: "MagicMock is strictly forbidden"
- Line 99: "Always test with actual data"

## Why This Matters

Mock tests give false confidence. They test that mocks work, not that the system works with ArXiv. Real tests:
- Catch actual API changes
- Verify network handling
- Ensure PDF parsing works
- Validate real-world functionality

## Conclusion

The test suite must be rebuilt from scratch with NO MOCKS. Every test must interact with the real ArXiv API and real papers. This is the only way to ensure the system actually works.
