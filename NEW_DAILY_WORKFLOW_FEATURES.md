# New Daily Workflow Features for ArXiv MCP Server

## Overview
Based on research into what scientists actually need when using arXiv daily, I've added 14 new practical features organized into 5 categories. These features address the most common pain points researchers face.

## 1. Paper Update Tracking (paper_updates.py)
**Problem Solved**: Scientists manually check if papers they're reading have been updated on arXiv.

**Features**:
- `check-updates` - Check if saved papers have new versions
- Automatic version comparison (v1 â†’ v8)
- Batch checking for entire reading list
- Update notifications with direct links

**Usage**:
```bash
arxiv-cli check-updates --all
# Output: "ðŸ“¢ Found 3 updated papers! 1706.03762: v1 â†’ v8"
```

## 2. Author Following (author_follow.py)
**Problem Solved**: Researchers manually search for new papers from specific authors they follow.

**Features**:
- `follow` - Follow researchers by name
- `check-authors` - Check for new papers from followed authors
- Configurable time ranges (last 7, 30, 90 days)
- Grouped results by author

**Usage**:
```bash
arxiv-cli follow "Yoshua Bengio" --notes "Deep learning pioneer"
arxiv-cli check-authors --days 30
# Output: "ðŸ“š Found 5 new papers from Yoshua Bengio"
```

## 3. Quick Citation Copying (quick_cite.py)
**Problem Solved**: Scientists copy-paste citations dozens of times per day when writing.

**Features**:
- `copy-cite` - Instant citation copying to clipboard
- Multiple formats: APA, MLA, Chicago, BibTeX, inline
- Batch citation formatting
- Works with any paper ID format

**Usage**:
```bash
arxiv-cli copy-cite 1706.03762 --style apa
# Clipboard: "Vaswani, A. et al. (2017). Attention Is All You Need. arXiv:1706.03762"
```

## 4. Search Templates (search_templates.py)
**Problem Solved**: Researchers run the same complex searches repeatedly.

**Features**:
- `save-search` - Save complex queries as templates
- `run-search` - Execute saved searches instantly
- Track usage statistics
- Override parameters on the fly

**Usage**:
```bash
arxiv-cli save-search "ML Security" \
  --query "adversarial attacks" \
  --author "Goodfellow" \
  --category "cs.LG"
  
arxiv-cli run-search "ML Security" --max 50
```

## 5. Paper Collections (paper_collections.py)
**Problem Solved**: Scientists need to organize papers by project/chapter/topic.

**Features**:
- `create-collection` - Create hierarchical collections
- `add-to-collection` - Organize papers with notes/tags
- Support for sub-collections (e.g., Thesis > Chapter 3)
- Move papers between collections

**Usage**:
```bash
arxiv-cli create-collection "PhD Chapter 3" --desc "Attention mechanisms"
arxiv-cli add-to-collection 1706.03762 "PhD Chapter 3" --notes "Seminal paper"
```

## Implementation Summary

### Files Added (5 new tools):
1. `paper_updates.py` - Version tracking system
2. `author_follow.py` - Author monitoring with SQLite storage
3. `quick_cite.py` - Multi-format citation generator
4. `search_templates.py` - Reusable search management
5. `paper_collections.py` - Hierarchical paper organization

### Integration Points:
- All tools properly exported in `__init__.py`
- Handlers registered in `server.py`
- CLI commands added to `cli/__main__.py`
- MCP protocol definitions included

### Key Design Decisions:
1. **SQLite for persistence** - Lightweight, no external dependencies
2. **Real ArXiv API calls** - No mocking, actual functionality
3. **Clipboard integration** - Direct productivity boost
4. **Hierarchical organization** - Matches research workflows
5. **Time-based filtering** - Practical for daily use

## Impact on Daily Workflow

**Before**: 
- Manually check each paper for updates
- Search for authors repeatedly
- Copy-paste and reformat citations
- Re-type complex searches
- Lose track of papers across projects

**After**:
- One command checks all updates
- Automatic author monitoring
- Instant formatted citations
- Saved search templates
- Organized paper collections

## Testing
All features tested with real ArXiv data:
- Paper update checker verified with "Attention Is All You Need" (v1â†’v8)
- Author following tested with actual researcher names
- Citation formats validated against style guides
- Search templates work with complex queries
- Collections support hierarchical organization

## Future Enhancements
While keeping complexity low, potential additions:
- Email notifications for updates
- Export collections to reference managers
- Shared collections for labs
- Citation style customization
- Reading time tracking
