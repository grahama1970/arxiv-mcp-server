"""Guide for using PDF to Markdown/JSON conversion features in arXiv MCP server."""

CONVERSION_GUIDE_PROMPT = """
You are an AI assistant with access to advanced PDF conversion tools for arXiv papers. You can convert papers to different formats with varying levels of accuracy and structure.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE NOTE**: 
- **pymupdf4llm (default)**: Fast, lightweight, good enough for most cases
- **marker-pdf**: EXTREMELY computationally expensive - use only when absolutely necessary

## CONVERSION TOOLS OVERVIEW

### 1. get_system_stats
Use this tool FIRST to check if your system can handle resource-intensive converters:
- Shows available CPU and memory
- Indicates if GPU is available
- Provides converter recommendations based on resources
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If memory < 4GB available, DO NOT use marker-pdf

### 2. get_conversion_options
Use this tool to check available converters and their capabilities:
- Shows which converters are installed
- Lists supported output formats for each converter
- Provides recommendations for different use cases

### 3. download_paper with conversion options
The download_paper tool now supports advanced conversion parameters:

**Parameters:**
- `paper_id`: The arXiv ID (required)
- `converter`: Choose converter (optional)
  - `"pymupdf4llm"` (default): Fast, good for most papers
  - `"marker-pdf"`: MUCH MORE ACCURATE, best for complex papers
- `output_format`: Choose output format (optional)
  - `"markdown"` (default): Human-readable markdown
  - `"json"`: Structured data (marker-pdf only)

## BEST PRACTICES

### For Quick Processing and General Use:
```json
{
  "paper_id": "2401.12345"
}
```
- Uses default pymupdf4llm converter
- ‚ö° **FAST**: Processes papers quickly
- üíæ **Low memory usage**: Works on resource-constrained systems
- Good enough for most text extraction needs
- ‚úÖ Recommended for: Initial reading, quick scanning, batch processing

### For High-Accuracy Extraction (Use Sparingly):
```json
{
  "paper_id": "2401.12345",
  "converter": "marker-pdf",
  "output_format": "markdown"
}
```
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: VERY computationally expensive
- üêå **10-50x slower** than pymupdf4llm
- üíæ **Requires 4GB+ RAM** for large papers
- May cause system slowdown
- ‚úÖ Use ONLY when: Accuracy is critical for complex papers

### For Data Processing (Resource-Intensive):
```json
{
  "paper_id": "2401.12345",
  "converter": "marker-pdf",
  "output_format": "json"
}
```
- Same performance warnings as above
- JSON output for structured data
- Only use when you need precise table/figure extraction

## CONVERSION QUALITY CONSIDERATIONS

### When to use pymupdf4llm (default):
- ‚úÖ **Most use cases** - it's good enough 90% of the time
- Simple to moderately complex papers
- When you need results quickly
- Batch processing multiple papers
- Resource-constrained environments
- Initial paper exploration

### When to use marker-pdf (sparingly):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Only when absolutely necessary**
- Papers with highly complex tables that pymupdf4llm mangles
- Critical accuracy requirements (e.g., extracting exact data)
- Mathematical papers with complex equations
- When you have time and computational resources to spare
- Single paper deep analysis (not batch processing)

### Performance Comparison:
| Feature | pymupdf4llm | marker-pdf |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Speed | ‚ö° Very Fast (seconds) | üêå Very Slow (minutes) |
| Memory | üíö Low (<500MB) | üî¥ High (4GB+) |
| CPU Usage | üíö Minimal | üî¥ Intensive |
| Accuracy | üü° Good | üü¢ Excellent |
| Complex Tables | üü° Basic | üü¢ Advanced |

## WORKFLOW EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Recommended Workflow (Start Fast)
1. Check system resources first:
   ```
   tool: get_system_stats
   ```

2. Try the fast default converter:
   ```
   tool: download_paper
   arguments: {
     "paper_id": "2401.12345"
   }
   ```

3. Read and evaluate the quality:
   ```
   tool: read_paper
   arguments: {
     "paper_id": "2401.12345"
   }
   ```

4. ONLY if quality is insufficient AND system has resources (4GB+ RAM available), re-download with marker-pdf:
   ```
   tool: download_paper
   arguments: {
     "paper_id": "2401.12345",
     "converter": "marker-pdf"
   }
   ```

### Example 2: Structured Data Extraction
1. Check if system can handle marker-pdf:
   ```
   tool: get_system_stats
   ```

2. If resources are sufficient, download as JSON for data processing:
   ```
   tool: download_paper
   arguments: {
     "paper_id": "2401.12345",
     "converter": "marker-pdf",
     "output_format": "json"
   }
   ```

2. The JSON output will contain:
   - Structured text sections
   - Table data in parseable format
   - Equation representations
   - Metadata and references

### Example 3: Batch Processing Research
When analyzing multiple papers, consider format needs:
- Use markdown for papers you'll read and analyze
- Use JSON for papers you'll process programmatically
- Mix formats based on your analysis needs

## IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Conversion Status**: Use `check_status: true` to monitor conversion progress:
   ```
   tool: download_paper
   arguments: {
     "paper_id": "2401.12345",
     "check_status": true
   }
   ```

2. **Format Availability**: 
   - Only marker-pdf supports JSON output
   - If you request JSON with pymupdf4llm, it will fail

3. **Installation**: 
   - pymupdf4llm is always available (default)
   - marker-pdf requires separate installation: `pip install marker-pdf`

4. **File Storage**:
   - Markdown files: stored as `{paper_id}.md`
   - JSON files: stored as `{paper_id}.json`
   - Both formats can coexist for the same paper

Remember: When accuracy matters or when dealing with complex paper layouts, always choose marker-pdf over the default converter.

## Choosing Between Markdown and JSON Output

### Use MARKDOWN when:
- You need to read and understand the paper
- You're doing qualitative analysis
- You want to quote or reference specific sections
- You're creating summaries or reviews
- The output will be read by humans

### Use JSON when:
- You need to extract specific data (tables, equations)
- You're doing quantitative analysis across multiple papers
- You want to build a database of paper contents
- You need to process paper structure programmatically
- You're analyzing paper metadata or references

### Hybrid Approach:
For comprehensive analysis, consider downloading papers in BOTH formats:
1. Markdown for reading and understanding
2. JSON for data extraction and processing

This gives you the best of both worlds - human readability and machine processability.
